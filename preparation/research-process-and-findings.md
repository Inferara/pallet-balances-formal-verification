# Research process and findings

## Textual description of fungible traits specification along with discovered assumptions regarding execution environment, required for its implementation.

## Methodology execution

Includes rust code of the functionality that has been researched
Notably WASM binary compilation artifacts

We will provide .rs files for the fungible conformance tests.
